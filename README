3D-Coat .3b file utilities.

=== Blender addons ===
# 3b file importer:
  3DCoat3BVOL.zip is Blender addon to import voxels as volume textured objects.
  To install
   1. Select menu "File->User Preferences..." and open "Addon" tab.
   2. Press "Install Addon..." button at bottom bar.
   3. Select 3DCoat3BVOL.zip.

  Import options
   - Import Scale (Number):
      Common scaling value for importing objects.
   - Import Surface (Check box):
      Ckeck this is you want to import surface mode's mesh.
      * Imported meshes are "RAW" mesh generated from voxels.
        Faces are separeted by 3D-Coat's internal voxel cells.
   - Voxel Directory (String):
      Relative path from the blend file.
      Converted voxel datas will be exported in here.
   - Use ID number(Check box):
      Impoted objects names ID number instead of volel layer name.
      This is a safety option for multi-byte environment user.
